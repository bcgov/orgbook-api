## DIY OrgBook BC Search Tutorial

This tutorial will take you through the very steps needed to start building your own OrgBook BC search component for your web application, complete with type-ahead (autocomplete) functionality. The tutorial will use code examples taken from the demo Angular application implemented in this repository, however the basic concepts will apply agnostic of the web framework you choose to use (or not). Please see the documentation [here](/demo/angular/README.md) if you are interested in running the demo on your own machine. Feel free to also glance through the code if you are interested in implementation details of the demo, otherwise you can follow along in this tutorial to start building your own autocomplete search component for verified, legally registered organizations within British Columbia using the OrgBook BC Open API.

### 1. Getting Started

Building an autocomplete search component is a fairly simple process and really only requires an HTML text `input` and a `div` overlay for displaying a list of results. Beyond these, results and data can be displayed in whichever format suits your goals. The built demo leverages Angular Material web components and thus leaves the heavy lifting of the UI to the library. Developers are thus focused on using the OrgBook BC Open API and binding data to the components.
